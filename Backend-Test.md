# Backend Coding Task

Using the following API (http://developer.com.marvelcomic.marvel.com), create a http proxy for the comics endpoint which takes a list of `comicId` and returns an array of comic details.
Additionally, it should use an in-memory cache to speed up subsequent requests.

Please use either Scala or Java, and any libraries of your choosing.

*Minimum Requirements:*
